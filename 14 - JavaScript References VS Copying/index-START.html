    // 1. ARRAY
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    let team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    // However what happens when we update that array ? Oh, no - we have edited the original array too !
    // Why ? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array !
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    team = players.slice();       // a)

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    team = [].concat(players);    // b)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    team = [...players];
    team[3] = 'Xul';              // c)
    // Or
    team = Array.from(players);   // d)

    // Let's say we have a person object
    const person = {

    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    let captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    captain = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
