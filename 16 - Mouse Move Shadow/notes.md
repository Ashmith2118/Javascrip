Learning more about mouse move
-Moving the shadow based on where the mouse is

going to listen for a mouse move event on .hero

for the destructure example:
- let { offsetX: x, offsetY: y } = e;
- we read this as let offSetX be equal to e.offsetX and offsetY = e.offsetY

if there are children elements inside the hero, we're getting the x,y of elements

how do we figure out how much the shadow moves based off of the mouse?
    based off walk and using math to determine how much we want to offset the shadows
