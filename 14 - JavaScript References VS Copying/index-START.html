    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    //基本类型,赋的是值
    let age1 = 123;
    let age2 = age1;
    age1 = 300;
    console.log(age1,age2)
    
    // Let's say we have an array
    //引用类型赋的是地址
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const team = players;
    team[3] = 'hello';
   
    //浅拷贝方式
    //1.ES6扩展运算符
    const team1 = [...players];
    team1[0] = 'hello';
    console.log(players)
    console.log(team1)

    //2.Array.form
    const team2 = Array.from(players);
    team2[0] = 'hello';
    // console.log(players)


    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    const person1 = person;
    person1.name = 'demo';
    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    let person2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
    person2.name = 'hello';
    console.log(person,person2)


    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
