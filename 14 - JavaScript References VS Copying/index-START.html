    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.


    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const players1 = players;
    console.log(players1);
    console.log(players);
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // players1[3] = "Tom";
    // console.log(players1);
    // console.log(players);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const players2 = Array.from(players);
    console.log(players2);
    players2[3] = "Tom";
    console.log(players2);
    console.log(players);
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const players3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const players4 = [...players, "Willy", "Manami"];
    console.log(players4);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    players4[3] = "Zac";
    console.log(players4);
    console.log(players); 

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const person1 = person;
    console.log(person1);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person2 = Object.assign({}, person);
    console.log(person2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const person3 = {...person, country: "America"};
    console.log(person3);
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    console.clear();
    console.table(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
