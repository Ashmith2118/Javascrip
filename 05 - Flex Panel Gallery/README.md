# Flex Panel Gallery :muscle:

The challenge is to create an interactive gallery with some animated (transformed) text, using `CSS Flexbox`, the `translate()` function and the `addEventListener()` method.

## Lessons Learned

I learned how to better use [CSS Flexbox], making some changes to the CSS properties in order to make the project compatible on mobile devices.
